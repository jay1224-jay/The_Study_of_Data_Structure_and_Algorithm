# The Study of Data Structure and Algorithm

The record of my study of Data Structure and Algorithm.

The book I read:  *Competitive Programmers' Handbook* by *Antti Laaksonen*
[book link](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

## Origin: 

I wanted to learn Data Structure and Algorithm for I had found that they had been used in many places(e.g. Software Engineering and Competitive Programming) and that they were really useful.

Still another reason is that I want to major in Computer Science(CS) in college and Data Structure and Algorithm are significant both in that major and in future career.

## Content

This repository contain the record of my learning history and notes, with real code aside.
